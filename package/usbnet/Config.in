config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_ASIX
	bool "ASIX AX8817X USB"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
	  Select this option to enable support for USB network adapters based on
	  the ASIX AX88xxx family of USB 2.0 chipsets. These chipsets are found
	  in many popular USB-to-Ethernet adapters.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_ASIX_179_178A
	bool "ASIX AX88179_178A USB"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
	  Select this option to enable support for USB network adapters based on
	  the ASIX AX88179/178A USB 3.0 chipsets. These chipsets are found in
	  USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet adapters.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_CDC_ETHER
	bool "CDC_ETHER"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
	  Select this option to enable support for CDC-Ethernet (Communications
	  Device Class), a standard USB protocol for Ethernet networking over USB.
	  This allows communication with devices that implement the CDC-Ethernet
	  protocol, such as USB network adapters and embedded devices. CDC-Ethernet
	  is widely supported across operating systems as a standard way to
	  provide network connectivity over USB.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_USB_DIRECT_NCM
	bool "USB Direct NCM"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
	  Select this option to enable support for CDC-NCM (Network Control Model),
	  a USB protocol that provides high-speed Ethernet networking. When enabled,
	  this device acts as a DHCP server and assigns IP addresses to other
	  devices that connect to it over USB. CDC-NCM is commonly used in modern
	  cellular modems and offers better performance than older protocols
	  like RNDIS.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_USB_DIRECT_NCM_CLIENT
	bool "USB Direct NCM-CLIENT"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
	  Select this option to enable CDC-NCM (Network Control Model) client mode.
	  When enabled, this device will operate as a client that receives an IP
	  address when connected to a CDC-NCM host device. For example, when
	  connected to a router or gateway operating in CDC-NCM host mode, this
	  device will obtain network connectivity from that host. This is the
	  opposite of CDC-NCM host mode where this device provides addresses to
	  others.

#config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_USB_DIRECT_ECM
#	bool "CDC-ECM"

#	  Enables CDC_ECM

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_CDC_NCM
	bool "CDC-NCM"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
	  USB CDC Network Control Model (NCM) driver. This enables support
	  for USB Ethernet devices that use the NCM protocol, which offers
	  higher throughput than CDC-ECM by supporting bundling of multiple
	  packets. Common devices include modern USB network adapters and
	  mobile broadband modems that implement the NCM standard.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_R8152
	bool "Realtek 8152"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
	  Select this option to enable support for USB network adapters based on
	  the Realtek RTL8152/RTL8153 chipsets.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_RNDIS
	bool "RNDIS"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
	  Select this option to enable support for RNDIS (Remote Network
	  Driver Interface Specification) over USB. This allows Ethernet-style
	  networking with USB devices that support the RNDIS protocol, such as
	  smartphones in USB tethering mode or cellular modems that expose an
	  RNDIS interface.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_WWAN_SERIAL
	bool "WWAN via USB SERIAL"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	select BR2_PACKAGE_PPPD
	help
	  Select this option to enable support for Wireless WAN (WWAN) devices
	  that connect via USB serial interfaces, such as LTE/4G modems.
	  This automatically enables the Point-to-Point Protocol daemon (pppd)
	  which is required for establishing cellular data connections with
	  these devices.
