BusyBox 1.37.0 httpd ACL Subdirectory Override Patch
=====================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
Allows subdirectories to completely bypass authentication (no Basic Auth 
challenge at all), even when parent directories require passwords.

Example: / requires password with 401 challenge, but /onvif/ has NO auth
challenge whatsoever - it's completely open.

CONFIGURATION SYNTAX:
/:user:password           # Protect root (sends 401 + WWW-Authenticate)
/onvif:*:                 # NO auth for /onvif (no 401, no challenge)

or simply:
/onvif:                   # Empty = completely open access

KEY CHANGES:
1. New is_open_access() function checks for open access paths
2. Uses "most specific path match" to find applicable rule
3. Completely skips HTTP 401 and WWW-Authenticate for open paths
4. Subdirectory rules override parent rules based on specificity

BEHAVIOR:
- Request to /          → 401 Unauthorized (requires auth)
- Request to /onvif/    → 200 OK (no auth challenge sent)
- Request to /onvif/foo → 200 OK (no auth challenge sent)

FILES MODIFIED:
- networking/httpd.c
  - Added: is_open_access() function
  - Modified: auth check in handle_incoming_and_exit()
