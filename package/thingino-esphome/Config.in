	  ESPHome Linux service for Thingino cameras.

	  A lightweight TCP service implementing the ESPHome Native API,
	  allowing Thingino cameras to function as ESPHome devices
	  discoverable by Home Assistant.

	  Features:
	  - Bluetooth Proxy for BLE device scanning (optional, requires bluetooth fragment)
	  - Auto-discovery via mDNS (_esphomelib._tcp)
	  - Plugin architecture for extensibility
	  - Native integration with Home Assistant

	  Optional features (enable via fragments):
	  - Bluetooth Proxy: Include "bluetooth" fragment in camera defconfig
	    Requires BLE-capable hardware (ATBM6031x, SSV6158, etc.)

	  Recommended:
	  - mDNS service (mdnsd or avahi-daemon) for auto-discovery
	  - ingenic-audiodaemon for MediaPlayer functionality
