	  HTTPS wrapper for BusyBox httpd using mbedTLS.

	  This package provides a lightweight SSL/TLS wrapper that allows
	  BusyBox httpd to serve HTTPS traffic. It listens on port 443 and
	  forwards decrypted traffic to httpd running on localhost.

	  Features:
	  - Small footprint using mbedTLS
	  - Automatic certificate generation using mbedtls-certgen
	  - Compatible with BusyBox httpd
	  - Minimal configuration required
